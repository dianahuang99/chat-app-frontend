# MERN Stack Chat App with WebSockets

Welcome to my React Chat App! This application allows users to register, log in, and send real-time messages to each other. It also provides a feature to see who's online and who's offline.

**Deployed Link:** [Live Demo](https://chat-app-frontend-i6dy.onrender.com/)

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication.

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages to each other in real-time using WebSockets.

- **Online Presence:** The app displays the list of online and offline users by using a grey or green dot to indictate the online status, letting you know who is currently active.

## Important Demo Note

Please note that to fully experience the real-time messaging feature and online presence, it's recommended to demo the app with two different browsers simultaneously. For example, you can log in with one user account using Google Chrome and log in with another user account using Mozilla Firefox. This will allow you to send messages between two separate accounts and see the online status change accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- WebSockets: A communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional data transfer between the client and server.

- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building the server-side of the app.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and chat messages.

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A secure way to authenticate users and maintain their session.
