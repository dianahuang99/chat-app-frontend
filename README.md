# MERN Stack Chat App with WebSockets

Welcome to my React Chat App! This application allows users to register, log in, and send real-time messages to each other. It also provides a feature to see who's online and who's offline.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication.

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages to each other in real-time using WebSockets.

- **Online Presence:** The app displays the list of online and offline users by using a grey or green dot to indictate the online status, letting you know who is currently active.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- WebSockets: A communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional data transfer between the client and server.

- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building the server-side of the app.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and chat messages.

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A secure way to authenticate users and maintain their session.
